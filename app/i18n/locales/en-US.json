  "faq.questions0": "What is Organic Reach Rewards?",
  "faq.answers0": " Organic Reach Rewards is a platform that empowers businesses to grow naturally by rewarding customers for social media engagement. It tracks Instagram posts, Stories, Reels, and comment mentions to offer valuable insights without requiring extra apps or physical punch cards.",

  "faq.questions1": "How does it work?",

  "faq.questions2": "Do customers need to download a separate app?",

  "faq.answers5": "Yes! Our platform supports Instagram automations. You can set up campaigns where customers who comment a specific keyword on your posts or reels automatically receive a personalized DM. It’s a great way to engage your audience, answer questions, share exclusive offers, or guide them to a reward page—completely hands-free.",

  "faq.questions6": "Is it easy to set up and manage?",
  "faq.answers6": "Absolutely. Once you establish how many tags count toward a reward, our system runs in the background, automatically tracking qualified mentions and delivering real-time engagement insights for quick, informed decisions.",

  "faq.questions7": "How is customer data handled?",
  "faq.answers7": "We only gather the information required to confirm eligible posts, respecting user privacy with a strict data deletion policy and compliance with all relevant data protection laws.",
